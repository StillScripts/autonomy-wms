# TypeScript Implementation Guidelines

## Type Definitions
1. Define types for all Laravel Models in `resources/js/types/models.ts`
2. Use inferred types and rely on the core model wherever possible
3. Aim to avoid redundant types
4. It is OK to use `any` when prototyping something if type errors are getting in the way.
