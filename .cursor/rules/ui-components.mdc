# Shadcn UI Components

This project uses @shadcn/ui for UI components. These are beautifully designed, simple, accessible components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

## Finding and Using Components

Available UI Components are located in the `resources/js/components/ui` directory.

## Using Components

Import components from the ui directory using the configured aliases:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
```

Example usage:

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Card Content</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

## Component Styling

This project uses the "new-york" style variant with the "neutral" base color and CSS variables for theming, as configured in `components.json`. The CSS variables are controlled and managed in `resources/css/app.css`
